            In September of 2015, President Obama <a href="https://youtu.be/Tpaj9Sm7i7I">announced</a> the release of data on all universities in the United States. The data includes "how much each school’s graduates earn, how much debt they graduate with, and what percentage of a school’s students can pay back their loans – which will help all of us see which schools do the best job of preparing America for success."

            So let's jump into the data and see what it tells us about how much each school’s graduates earn, how much debt they graduate with, and what percentage of a school’s students can pay back their loans. But first, to get some perspective on the issue of college debt, I want to address something we've all heard a lot about: the rising cost of college tuition.
            There are many articles about this subject in publications such as the New York Times (ref <a href="https://nyti.ms/2oJYPq0">1</a>, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2jDbkDz">2</a>), The Washington Post (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/07/college-tuition-is-getting-more-expensive-heres-whos-actually-to-blame/">ref</a>), Time Magazine (<a href="http://time.com/4472261/college-cost-history/">ref</a>), and many others.

            In fig. 1 I plot the average faculty salary vs the in-state tuition and fees at nearly every university in the United States. I've color-coded the universities by sector in order to make better sense of the data.
            An interactive version of this plot can be found on the app page <a href="{% url 'blog:collegescorecard' %}">here</a>.

                <b>Fig. 1</b>  Dynamic plot of faculty salary vs in-state tuition and fees from 2001 to 2014. The dot colors are blue: public 2 year; green: public 4 year; orange: non-profit 4 year; red: non-profit 2 year; purple: for-profit 4 year; and brown: for-profit 2 year colleges. The tuition and fees at the most expensive schools in 2001 were about $28k/year in 2001, compared to around $50k in 2014. This is an increase in sticker price of roughly 80%, compared to inflation which caused a net increase of 34% from 2001 to 2014. An interactive version of the plot is on the app page <a href="{% url 'blog:collegescorecard' %}">here</a>.

            The increase in tuition and faculty salaries is striking. Take for example Columbia University in New York. In 2001, tuition and fees was $27k/year.
            In 2014 that number grew to $51k/year, an 89% increase. If

            What immediately catches my eye in fig. 1 is the linearity of the non-profit 4 year college (orange) data.
